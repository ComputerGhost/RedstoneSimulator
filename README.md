# RedstoneSimulator

This is a Minecraft redstone simulation library to allow easily creation and manipulation of redstone circuitry in C++.  It also supports schematic imports and exports.

I am no longer developing this project, but I'll leave the source here for anyone who wants to take it and run with it.
