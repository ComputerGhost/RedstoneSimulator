	This document details the steps needed to add a new component to the redstone library.  All of these steps need to be followed or else it won't work right.

1 - Add source and header files for new component in src/components directory and add to project in same filter.

2 - New components must inherit from Redstone::Component.  They must also take care to implement these methods correctly:
	- clone
	- update
	- getId
	- operator==

3 - If a Redstone::Component::ID does not already exist for your component, create one in the Component.h file.

4 - Update all other components.  How does each other component interract with yours?  Add support in each one that does respond to yours.

5 - Add support in the Schematic class.

7 - Create a test program to run it through its loops.
